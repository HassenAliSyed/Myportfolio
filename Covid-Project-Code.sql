Data Analysis Using SQL Language

Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types



— Select all data we are working with in CovidDeaths table
Select *
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
order by 3,4

— Select all data we are going to be working with in Covid Vaccination table
Select *
From PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations
order by 3,4


-- Select Data that we are going to be starting with

Select Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
order by 1,2



-- Total Cases vs Total Deaths
-- Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country

Select Location, date, total_cases,total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where location like '%states%'
order by 1,2


-- Total Cases vs Population
-- Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid

Select Location, date, Population, total_cases,  (total_cases/population)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
order by 1,2



-- Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population

Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
Group by Location, Population
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


—  Find the death percentage

Select Location, date, total_cases,  total_deaths (total_cases/population)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
order by 1,2


— Find content that is not null

Select *
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null
Order by 3,4



-- GLOBAL NUMBERS

Select date, SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
where continent is not null 
--Group By date
order by 1,2




-- Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query

With PopvsVac (Continent, Location, Date, Population, New_Vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated)
as
(
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
--, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/population)*100
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null 
--order by 2,3
)
Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100
From PopvsVac


-- Creating View to store data for later visualizations

Create View PercentPopulationVaccinated as
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
--, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/population)*100
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null
